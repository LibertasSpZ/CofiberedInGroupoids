# Stacks project 

This repository contains the code necessary to define stacks in Lean. More specifically, the code here sets up a basic theory of fibered categories (API for pullbacks, results about naturality, etc - mostly following the exposition in *Stacks and Moduli* by Jarod Alper) and states the conditions for a functor `p : X â†’ S` fibered in groupoids to be a stack. As an application, we prove that the empty category is a stack over itself.
